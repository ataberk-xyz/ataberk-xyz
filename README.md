# Ataberk Yavuzer

**Smart Contract Auditor & Offensive Security Engineer** — 7+ years across Web3 and traditional security.

Pentesting (web · network · Active Directory) → blockchain security (Solidity · Move).
Ex-Principal Smart Contract Auditor @ Hacken · Lead Offensive Security Engineer @ Halborn.
I break things, then build tools so they break less.

## Focus

- **Smart contract audits** — Solidity & Move; DeFi, protocols, bridges. Manual deep-dive, not just tooling.
- **Offensive security** — web, network & Active Directory; red-team mindset.
- **Security tooling** — AI-assisted automation and agentic workflows.

## Projects

**[gossipcat](https://github.com/gossipcat-ai/gossipcat-ai)** · `TypeScript` `MCP` `Multi-agent`
A multi-agent code-review orchestrator that filters LLM hallucinations. Every finding must cite a real
`file:line`; peer agents verify the citation against actual source — a mechanical check, not LLM-as-judge.
Verified findings and caught hallucinations become grounded reward signals that update per-agent
competency scores. In-context reinforcement learning at the prompt layer — no weights touched.

**[Gamebrew](https://github.com/ataberk-xyz/Gamebrew)** · `C#` `Unity 6` `MCP`
A self-hosted bridge that hands your running Unity game to an AI agent — walk the player, orbit a prop to
inspect it, capture the view, read live scene state, all over one loopback MCP port. No cloud, no SDK lock-in.
